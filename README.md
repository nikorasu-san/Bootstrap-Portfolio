# Bootstrap-Portfolio

- Creating a mock Porfolio site using Bootstraps

### Notes

- I used my CSS to make some tweaks for styling to better match the original portfolio's style scheme

- I also used media queries in my CSS to force spacing to better align with the screenshot mock ups.

- After loading the site into github I noticed that Chrome was misleading in how the site showed on my iPhone 7. With Arnab's help, I discovered that empty div-rows did not force the main content under the nav. <br> resolved the issue.
