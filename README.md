# Bootstrap-Portfolio

- Creating a Portfolio site using Bootstraps based on a image/template design. This site will host the projects worked on during the NU Web Developer Bootcamp

## Notes

### Shout-outs

- After loading the site into github I noticed that Chrome was misleading in how the site showed on my iPhone 7. With Arnab's help, I discovered that empty div-rows did not force the main content under the nav. <br> resolved the issue.

### Known issues

- Clicking the contact submit button does not action a submit task. Also the Portfolio images are not clickable.

### CSS

- I used my CSS to make some tweaks for styling to better match the original portfolio's style scheme.

- For personal taste, I added a setting to turn the non-nav URLs green for mobile users. Also added the a font color change when those URLs are hovered for desktop viewers.

- I also used media queries in my CSS to force spacing to better align with the screenshot mock ups.

## Future Recommendations

- Rely more on the Bootstraps grid system rather than feeling to married to the mock-ups. The inner perfectionist led me to using media queries to get as identical as possible. Made changes 2/27 to lean more on Bootstrap features.

- Play more with using the grid system in the the nav bar. It may allow the responsive text spacing in the nav bar that I want without media queries.
